# AlgorithmVisualizer

**AlgorithmVisualizer** is an open-source web project which visualizes different pathfinding and sorting algorithms. I hope that you will enjoy this project just as much as I enjoyed building it. If you find any bugs, feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.

>**My initial idea was to learn algorithms and react in the meantime so I decided to build this project. Firstly, I used react-redux and then switched to react-hooks in order to practice React. If you're interested to see the two different approaches, check the repository branches.**
## Avalailable algorithms

***

**Pathfinding algorithms:**
* ___A* Search___ is weighted and it is arguably the best pathfinding algorithm out there. It uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path and is much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm
* **Dijkstra's** Algorithm is also weighted. Dijkstra's algorithm is the father of pathfinding algorithms and it guarantees the shortest path
* **Breath-first Search** is unweighted and it's a good algorithm which guarantees the shortest path
* **Depth-first Search** is unweighted and it's a very bad algorithm for pathfinding. Moreover, it does not guarantee the shortest path
***

**Sorting algorithms:**
* Merge sort
* Buble sort 
* Heap sort
* Quick sort

P.S Many more algorithms are going to come out with the next version of this application. By the way, if you like to project feel free to give it a star.
